## About
UbiWP is a beautiful WP Admin Panel Theme that optimizes WordPress and makes it look more beautiful. It also includes fixes that make it more mobile responsive as well as changes such as fixing the device preview sizes in the preview customizer to more modern sizes of an iPhone Pro 12 Max and an iPad Pro 11".

Some screenshots can be seen here: https://ubiwp.com/

The theme was tested on various screen sizes including phones and tablets, making for a great user experience.

Many features such as custom profile pictures or simpified menus for shop managers are still work in progress and are not available in this beta.

## Intallation
This is simply a WordPress Plugin. All you have to do is download this repository as a Zip and install it as you would install any other plugin.

You can also clone contents into a folder in the `wp-content\plugins` folder within your WordPress installation if you are testing this plugin on your own environment. 
If you need a testing environment I recommend Local https://localwp.com/ it will create a WP website on your hard drive and you can place the plugin there.

This plugin does not interact with the Database and all it pretty much is, is a CSS file loader with some JS - therefore it should be ok to load on your own website.
